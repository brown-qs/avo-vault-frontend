title: How does Lido on Polygon work?
---


When staking with Lido on Polygon, users receive stMATIC tokens as soon as they submit MATIC. Lido will calculate the current stMATIC/MATIC ratio and send the correct amount to the user.
MATIC tokens are then delegated across Polygon validators that are part of Lido on Polygon.
