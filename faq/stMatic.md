title: What is stMATIC?
---


stMATIC is an ERC20 token that represents the account’s share of the total supply of MATIC tokens inside PoLido system. It is a non-rebasable token, which means that the amount of tokens in the user’s wallet is not going to change. During time, the value of this token is changing, since the amount of MATIC tokens inside the protocol is not constant.
stMATIC will be supported by a variety of DeFi applications across Ethereum and Polygon networks.
